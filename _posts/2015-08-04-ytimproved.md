[Userscript][ajs], [Styles][acss]

I have changed YT Improved, moderately, to work with youtube's current watch8 interface. 
That is, the web player where there is a transparent control bar.

This works well enough on firefox, with custom thin scrollbars. IT may not work as well on other browsers or browsers that have big chunky scrollbars.

Features:
Hides Unnecessary page elements
Makes player fit entire window
Makes description and metadata a on-hover element only
Makes playlists slide in from the side
Redirects if a video has an age limit, to prevent need to log in
Adds 'live thumbnails'
Uses a darker interface
