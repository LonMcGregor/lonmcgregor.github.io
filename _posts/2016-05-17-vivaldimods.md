A collection of tools to help managing <a href="https://vivaldi.com">vivaldi</a> installations, until such a time as these become integrated into the browser itself. Designed for windows, the repo should be placed as a sub-directory of the Vivaldi/Application directory.

<h3>Custom Styles</h3>
A set of styles used to improve the interface. Among other things, these hide the irrelevant back/forward/home buttons.

The styles themselves are stored in mystyles.css. They can be installed by using the customstyles.bat batch file script. This replaces the vivaldi web page with browser.html.

<h3>Profile Manager GUI</h3>
The vivaldiprof.hta file is an HTML executable [yes, windows has those, for better or worse]. It provides a simple way to launch different vivaldi profiles based on your input. It defaults to a profile called UserDefault.

This launcher also has the ability to launch a given profile with additional parameters to expose the user interface inspector.

<h3>Speed Dials</h3>
These are a collection fo speed dials that I use, to replace thumbnails. Not too interesting.
