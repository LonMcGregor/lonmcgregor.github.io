As part of a summer internship, I have worked as part of an ongoign project to add support for 'Tactics' and 'Dead Annotation Removal' to the Dafny Visual Studio extension.

Some of the things that this adds to the base Dafny extension include:

* Syntax support for Tactics
* Identifying tactic failures
* Expanding tactics in-line
* Identifying dead annotations
* Auto-removal of dead annotations
